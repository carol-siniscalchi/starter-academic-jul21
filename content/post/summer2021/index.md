We had a summer full of lab work here. We completed hundreds of target capture preps for sequencing and received A LOT of new data to analyze. Yay!
I also trained some of the undergrads in microbiome DNA extraction and PCRs, for one of our side projects. 
We're gearing up for Botany2021, where the lab will present 2 talks and 2 posters! Check out my twitter for details!
