 abstract = {Chresta filicifolia is described and illustrated. It is a
perennial herb known only from open vegetation on top of small
rock outcrops at the Rio Doce Valley in Eastern Minas Gerais,
Southeastern Brazil. This is the first record of a species of
Chresta endemic to a phytogeographic domain other than the
Cerrado and Caatinga , since those outcrops are included in the
Mata Atlântica Domain (Atlantic Forest). The new species is
closely related to C. harleyi and C. hatschbachii, but differs
from these by its leaves, which are larger and more deeply lobed
than those of the other two species, and also by its florets and
cypselae, which are both larger in Chresta filicifolia. Moreover,
the two other species are allopatric from C. filicifolia , being
restricted to the Caatinga Domain . The southernmost distribution
of C. harleyi lies more than 500 km away from the locality where
the new species is found, making this discovery unexpected, and
raising interesting biogeographical questions, which are briefly
addressed here.},
