 abstract = {Asteraceae, or the sunflower family, is the largest family of
flowering plants and is usually considered difficult to work
with, not only due to its size, but also because of the abundant
cases of polyploidy and ancient whole-genome duplications.
Traditional molecular systematics studies were often impaired by
the low levels of variation found in chloroplast markers and the
high paralogy of traditional nuclear markers like ITS.
Next-generation sequencing and novel phylogenomics methods, such
as target capture and Hyb-Seq, have provided new ways of studying
the phylogeny of the family with great success. While the
resolution of the backbone of the family is in progress with some
results already published, smaller studies focusing on internal
clades of the phylogeny are important to increase sampling and
allow morphological, biogeography, and diversification analyses,
as well as serving as basis to test the current infrafamilial
classification. Vernonieae is one of the largest tribes in the
family, accounting for approximately 1,500 species. From the
1970s to the 1990s, the tribe went through several reappraisals,
mainly due to the splitting of the mega genus Vernonia into
several smaller segregates. Only three phylogenetic studies
focusing on the Vernonieae have been published to date, both
using a few molecular markers, overall presenting low resolution
and support in deepest nodes, and presenting conflicting
topologies when compared. In this study, we present the first
attempt at studying the phylogeny of Vernonieae using
phylogenomics. Even though our sampling includes only around 4%
of the diversity of the tribe, we achieved complete resolution of
the phylogeny with high support recovering approximately 700
nuclear markers obtained through target capture. We also analyzed
the effect of missing data using two different matrices with
different number of markers and the difference between
concatenated and gene tree analysis.},
