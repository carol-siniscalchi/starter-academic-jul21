abstract: Asteraceae, or the sunflower family, is the largest family of flowering
  plants and is usually considered difficult to work with, not only due to its size,
  but also because of the abundant cases of polyploidy and ancient whole-genome duplications.
  Traditional molecular systematics studies were often impaired by the low levels
  of variation found in chloroplast markers and the high paralogy of traditional nuclear
  markers like ITS. Next-generation sequencing and novel phylogenomics methods, such
  as target capture and Hyb-Seq, have provided new ways of studying the phylogeny
  of the family with great success. While the resolution of the backbone of the family
  is in progress with some results already published, smaller studies focusing on
  internal clades of the phylogeny are important to increase sampling and allow morphological,
  biogeography, and diversification analyses, as well as serving as basis to test
  the current infrafamilial classification. Vernonieae is one of the largest tribes
  in the family, accounting for approximately 1,500 species. From the 1970s to the
  1990s, the tribe went through several reappraisals, mainly due to the splitting
  of the mega genus Vernonia into several smaller segregates. Only three phylogenetic
  studies focusing on the Vernonieae have been published to date, both using a few
  molecular markers, overall presenting low resolution and support in deepest nodes,
  and presenting conflicting topologies when compared. In this study, we present the
  first attempt at studying the phylogeny of Vernonieae using phylogenomics. Even
  though our sampling includes only around 4% of the diversity of the tribe, we achieved
  complete resolution of the phylogeny with high support recovering approximately
  700 nuclear markers obtained through target capture. We also analyzed the effect
  of missing data using two different matrices with different number of markers and
  the difference between concatenated and gene tree analysis.
