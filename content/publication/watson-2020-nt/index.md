abstract: Abstract Asteraceae account for 10% of all flowering plant species, and
  35%?40% of these are in five closely related tribes that total over 10?000 species.
  These tribes include Anthemideae, Astereae, Calenduleae, Gnaphalieae, and Senecioneae,
  which form one of two enormous clades within Subfamily Asteroideae. We took a phylogenomics
  approach to resolve evolutionary relationships among these five tribes. We sampled
  the nuclear and plastid genomes via HybSeq target enrichment and genome skimming,
  and recovered 74 plastid genes and nearly 1000 nuclear loci, known as Conserved
  Orthologous Sequences. We tested for conflicting support in both data sets and used
  network analyses to assess patterns of reticulation to explain the early evolutionary
  history of this lineage, which has experienced whole-genome duplications and rapid
  radiations. We found concordance and conflicting support in both data sets and documented
  four ancient hybridization events. Due to the timing of the early radiation of this
  five-tribe lineage, shortly before the Eocene?Oligocene extinction event (34?MYA),
  early lineages were likely lost, obscuring some details of their early evolutionary
  history.
