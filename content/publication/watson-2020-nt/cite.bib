 abstract = {Abstract Asteraceae account for 10% of all flowering plant
species, and 35%?40% of these are in five closely related
tribes that total over 10?000 species. These tribes include
Anthemideae, Astereae, Calenduleae, Gnaphalieae, and
Senecioneae, which form one of two enormous clades within
Subfamily Asteroideae. We took a phylogenomics approach to
resolve evolutionary relationships among these five tribes. We
sampled the nuclear and plastid genomes via HybSeq target
enrichment and genome skimming, and recovered 74 plastid genes
and nearly 1000 nuclear loci, known as Conserved Orthologous
Sequences. We tested for conflicting support in both data sets
and used network analyses to assess patterns of reticulation to
explain the early evolutionary history of this lineage, which
has experienced whole-genome duplications and rapid radiations.
We found concordance and conflicting support in both data sets
and documented four ancient hybridization events. Due to the
timing of the early radiation of this five-tribe lineage,
shortly before the Eocene?Oligocene extinction event (34?MYA),
early lineages were likely lost, obscuring some details of their
early evolutionary history.},
