 abstract = {Chresta is a genus mostly endemic to Brazil that presents several
rupicolous species with naturally fragmented distributions.
Aiming to facilitate studies about genetic diversity and
structure in these species, we developed a set of 22 nuclear and
6 plastid microsatellite markers that are transferable among
different species of the genus. We used previously obtained
genomic data from target capture and Illumina sequencing to
identify putative repeat regions, designed and synthesized
primers, and genotyped individuals from different populations of
three species. All loci were successfully amplified in all three
species and were overall variable, except for the plastid
markers, which were monomorphic in two species. These newly
developed microsatellites will be useful in studies focusing on
the population genetics of Chresta.},
