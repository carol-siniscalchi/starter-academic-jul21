 abstract = {Traditionally, the generation and use of biodiversity data and
their associated specimen objects have been primarily the purview
of individuals and small research groups. While deposition of
data and specimens in herbaria and other repositories has long
been the norm, throughout most of their history, these resources
have been accessible only to a small community of specialists.
Through recent concerted efforts, primarily at the level of
national and international governmental agencies over the last
two decades, the pace of biodiversity data accumulation has
accelerated, and a wider array of biodiversity scientists has
gained access to this massive accumulation of resources, applying
them to an ever-widening compass of research pursuits. We review
how these new resources and increasing access to them are
affecting the landscape of biodiversity research in plants today,
focusing on new applications across evolution, ecology, and other
fields that have been enabled specifically by the availability of
these data and the global scope that was previously beyond the
reach of individual investigators. We give an overview of recent
advances organized along three lines: broad-scale analyses of
distributional data and spatial information, phylogenetic
research circumscribing large clades with comprehensive taxon
sampling, and data sets derived from improved accessibility of
biodiversity literature. We also review synergies between large
data resources and more traditional data collection paradigms,
describe shortfalls and how to overcome them, and reflect on the
future of plant biodiversity analyses in light of increasing
linkages between data types and scientists in our field.},
