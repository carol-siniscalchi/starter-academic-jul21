abstract: A hallmark of flowering plants is their ability to invade some of the most
  extreme and dynamic habitats, including cold and dry biomes, to a far greater extent
  than other land plants. Recent work has provided insight to the phylogenetic distribution
  and evolutionary mechanisms which have enabled this success, yet needed is a synthesis
  of evolutionary perspectives with plant physiological traits, morphology, and genomic
  diversity. Linking these disparate components will not only lead to better understand
  the evolutionary parallelism and diversification of plants with these two strategies,
  but also to provide the framework needed for directing future research. We summarize
  the primary physiological and structural traits involved in response to cold- and
  drought stress, outline the phylogenetic distribution of these adaptations, and
  describe the recurring association of these changes with rapid diversification events
  that occurred in multiple lineages over the past 15 million years. Across these
  threefold facets of dry-cold correlation (traits, phylogeny, and time) we stress
  the contrast between (a) the amazing diversity of solutions flowering plants have
  developed in the face of extreme environments and (b) a broad correlation between
  cold and dry adaptations that in some cases may hint at deep common origins.
