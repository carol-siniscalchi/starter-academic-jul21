 abstract = {A hallmark of flowering plants is their ability to invade some of
the most extreme and dynamic habitats, including cold and dry
biomes, to a far greater extent than other land plants. Recent
work has provided insight to the phylogenetic distribution and
evolutionary mechanisms which have enabled this success, yet
needed is a synthesis of evolutionary perspectives with plant
physiological traits, morphology, and genomic diversity. Linking
these disparate components will not only lead to better
understand the evolutionary parallelism and diversification of
plants with these two strategies, but also to provide the
framework needed for directing future research. We summarize the
primary physiological and structural traits involved in response
to cold- and drought stress, outline the phylogenetic
distribution of these adaptations, and describe the recurring
association of these changes with rapid diversification events
that occurred in multiple lineages over the past 15 million
years. Across these threefold facets of dry-cold correlation
(traits, phylogeny, and time) we stress the contrast between (a)
the amazing diversity of solutions flowering plants have
developed in the face of extreme environments and (b) a broad
correlation between cold and dry adaptations that in some cases
may hint at deep common origins.},
