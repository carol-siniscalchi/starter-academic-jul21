abstract: "Phylogenetic datasets are now commonly generated using short-read sequencing\
  \ technologies unhampered by degraded DNA, such as that often extracted from herbarium\
  \ specimens. The compatibility of these methods with herbarium specimens has precipitated\
  \ an increase in broad sampling of herbarium specimens for inclusion in phylogenetic\
  \ studies. Understanding which sample characteristics are predictive of sequencing\
  \ success can guide researchers in the selection of tissues and specimens most likely\
  \ to yield good results. Multiple recent studies have considered the relationship\
  \ between sample characteristics and DNA yield and sequence capture success. Here\
  \ we report an analysis of the relationship between sample characteristics and sequencing\
  \ success for nearly 8,000 herbarium specimens. This study, the largest of its kind,\
  \ is also the first to include a measure of specimen quality (``greenness'') as\
  \ a predictor of DNA sequencing success. We found that taxonomic group and source\
  \ herbarium are strong predictors of both DNA yield and sequencing success and that\
  \ the most important specimen characteristics for predicting success differ for\
  \ DNA yield and sequencing: greenness was the strongest predictor of DNA yield,\
  \ and age was the strongest predictor of proportion-on-target reads recovered. Surprisingly,\
  \ the relationship between age and proportion-on-target reads is the inverse of\
  \ expectations; older specimens performed slightly better in our capture-based protocols.\
  \ We also found that DNA yield itself is not a strong predictor of sequencing success.\
  \ Most literature on DNA sequencing from herbarium specimens considers specimen\
  \ selection for optimal DNA extraction success, which we find to be an inappropriate\
  \ metric for predicting success using next-generation sequencing technologies."
