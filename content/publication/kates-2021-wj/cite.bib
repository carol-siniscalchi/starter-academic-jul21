 abstract = {Phylogenetic datasets are now commonly generated using short-read
sequencing technologies unhampered by degraded DNA, such as that
often extracted from herbarium specimens. The compatibility of
these methods with herbarium specimens has precipitated an
increase in broad sampling of herbarium specimens for inclusion
in phylogenetic studies. Understanding which sample
characteristics are predictive of sequencing success can guide
researchers in the selection of tissues and specimens most likely
to yield good results. Multiple recent studies have considered
the relationship between sample characteristics and DNA yield and
sequence capture success. Here we report an analysis of the
relationship between sample characteristics and sequencing
success for nearly 8,000 herbarium specimens. This study, the
largest of its kind, is also the first to include a measure of
specimen quality (``greenness'') as a predictor of DNA sequencing
success. We found that taxonomic group and source herbarium are
strong predictors of both DNA yield and sequencing success and
that the most important specimen characteristics for predicting
success differ for DNA yield and sequencing: greenness was the
strongest predictor of DNA yield, and age was the strongest
predictor of proportion-on-target reads recovered. Surprisingly,
the relationship between age and proportion-on-target reads is
the inverse of expectations; older specimens performed slightly
better in our capture-based protocols. We also found that DNA
yield itself is not a strong predictor of sequencing success.
Most literature on DNA sequencing from herbarium specimens
considers specimen selection for optimal DNA extraction success,
which we find to be an inappropriate metric for predicting
success using next-generation sequencing technologies.},
