 abstract = {Abstract Compositae accounts for ca. 10% of all flowering
plants, being found in nearly all types of habitats worldwide.
The family is particularly diverse in markedly dry and seasonal
habitats, raising questions about what processes led to
diversification in these challenging environments. The presence
of C4 and CAM metabolism in some Compositae taxa has been known
since the 1970s, and although some of these taxa have been
extensively studied, such as Flaveria, there has been no
systematic effort in gathering and reviewing data about
photosynthesis metabolism in the family in the last few decades.
In the present paper, we gathered data from more than 50
articles, spanning several different methods, raising
information on photosynthesis metabolism for more than 400
Compositae species. We also present newly acquired carbon
isotope data for 66 species, mostly from previously unsampled
tribes. We analyzed photosynthesis metabolism in the tribe
Tageteae using a phylogeny and ancestral character
reconstruction. C4 photosynthesis in Compositae is restricted to
two tribes: Tageteae, where it had two independent origins, and
Coreopsideae, where it seems to have arisen only once. CAM
metabolism is found in succulent members of tribe Senecioneae,
and in Astereae and Eupatorieae, with an unknown number of
evolutionary origins. We discuss the evolutionary implications
of the results and propose future directions for studying
photosynthesis metabolism in the family.},
