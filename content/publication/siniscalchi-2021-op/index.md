abstract: 'Abstract Compositae accounts for ca. 10% of all flowering plants, being
  found in nearly all types of habitats worldwide. The family is particularly diverse
  in markedly dry and seasonal habitats, raising questions about what processes led
  to diversification in these challenging environments. The presence of C4 and CAM
  metabolism in some Compositae taxa has been known since the 1970s, and although
  some of these taxa have been extensively studied, such as Flaveria, there has been
  no systematic effort in gathering and reviewing data about photosynthesis metabolism
  in the family in the last few decades. In the present paper, we gathered data from
  more than 50 articles, spanning several different methods, raising information on
  photosynthesis metabolism for more than 400 Compositae species. We also present
  newly acquired carbon isotope data for 66 species, mostly from previously unsampled
  tribes. We analyzed photosynthesis metabolism in the tribe Tageteae using a phylogeny
  and ancestral character reconstruction. C4 photosynthesis in Compositae is restricted
  to two tribes: Tageteae, where it had two independent origins, and Coreopsideae,
  where it seems to have arisen only once. CAM metabolism is found in succulent members
  of tribe Senecioneae, and in Astereae and Eupatorieae, with an unknown number of
  evolutionary origins. We discuss the evolutionary implications of the results and
  propose future directions for studying photosynthesis metabolism in the family.'
