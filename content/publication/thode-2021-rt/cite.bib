 abstract = {We assembled new plastomes of 19 species of Mikania and of
Ageratina fastigiata, Litothamnus nitidus, and Stevia collina,
all belonging to tribe Eupatorieae (Asteraceae). We analyzed the
structure and content of the assembled plastomes and used the
newly generated sequences to infer phylogenetic relationships
and study the effects of different data partitions and inference
methods on the topologies. Most phylogenetic studies with
plastomes ignore that processes like recombination and
biparental inheritance can occur in this organelle, using the
whole genome as a single locus. Our study sought to compare this
approach with multispecies coalescent methods that assume that
different parts of the genome evolve at different rates. We
found that the overall gene content, structure, and orientation
are very conserved in all plastomes of the studied species. As
observed in other Asteraceae, the 22 plastomes assembled here
contain two nested inversions in the LSC region. The plastomes
show similar length and the same gene content. The two most
variable regions within Mikania are rpl32-ndhF and rpl16-rps3,
while the three genes with the highest percentage of variable
sites are ycf1, rpoA, and psbT. We generated six phylogenetic
trees using concatenated maximum likelihood and multispecies
coalescent methods and three data partitions: coding and
non-coding sequences and both combined. All trees strongly
support that the sampled Mikania species form a monophyletic
group, which is further subdivided into three clades. The
internal relationships within each clade are sensitive to the
data partitioning and inference methods employed. The trees
resulting from concatenated analysis are more similar among each
other than to the correspondent tree generated with the same
data partition but a different method. The multispecies
coalescent analysis indicate a high level of incongruence
between species and gene trees. The lack of resolution and
congruence among trees can be explained by the sparse sampling
(~ 0.45% of the currently accepted species) and by the low
number of informative characters present in the sequences. Our
study sheds light into the impact of data partitioning and
methods over phylogenetic resolution and brings relevant
information for the study of Mikania diversity and evolution, as
well as for the Asteraceae family as a whole.},
