abstract: Chresta encompasses 15 species of Compositae, mostly restricted to the Brazilian
  Cerrado and Caatinga. Previous taxonomic studies have shown that there is variation
  in pollen types among species, but did not fully describe them. In order to provide
  full pollen descriptions and analyze their relation to the group's taxonomy and
  phylogeny, pollen grains from 14 species were examined using light and scanning
  electron microscopy. Acetolysed pollen grains were measured and photographed on
  a light microscope and non-acetolysed pollen grains were examined using scanning
  electron microscopy. Three pollen types were found in the genus, corresponding to
  Vernonia-types A, C and F. In general, pollen grains are isopolar, large, prolate-spheroidal,
  spheroidal or oblate-spheroidal and the polar area is usually small. The variation
  in quantitative characters allowed the construction of a dichotomous identification
  key. Pollen types do not correlate to clades found in the most recent phylogeny
  of the genus. Similarities and differences of pollen patterns of Chresta and other
  Vernonieae genera are briefly discussed.
