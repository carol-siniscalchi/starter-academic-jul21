 abstract = {Chresta encompasses 15 species of Compositae, mostly restricted
to the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga. Previous taxonomic studies
have shown that there is variation in pollen types among species,
but did not fully describe them. In order to provide full pollen
descriptions and analyze their relation to the group's taxonomy
and phylogeny, pollen grains from 14 species were examined using
light and scanning electron microscopy. Acetolysed pollen grains
were measured and photographed on a light microscope and
non-acetolysed pollen grains were examined using scanning
electron microscopy. Three pollen types were found in the genus,
corresponding to Vernonia-types A, C and F. In general, pollen
grains are isopolar, large, prolate-spheroidal, spheroidal or
oblate-spheroidal and the polar area is usually small. The
variation in quantitative characters allowed the construction of
a dichotomous identification key. Pollen types do not correlate
to clades found in the most recent phylogeny of the genus.
Similarities and differences of pollen patterns of Chresta and
other Vernonieae genera are briefly discussed.},
