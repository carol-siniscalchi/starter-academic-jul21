abstract: 'Abstract Rock daisies (Perityleae; Compositae) are a diverse clade of seven
  genera and ca. 84 minimum-rank taxa that mostly occur as narrow endemics on sheer
  rock cliffs throughout the southwest United States and northern Mexico. Taxonomy
  of Perityleae has traditionally been based on morphology and cytogenetics. To test
  taxonomic hypotheses and utility of characters emphasized in past treatments, we
  present the first densely sampled molecular phylogenies of Perityleae and reconstruct
  trait and chromosome evolution. We inferred phylogenetic trees from whole chloroplast
  genomes, nuclear ribosomal cistrons, and hundreds of low-copy nuclear genes using
  genome skimming and target capture. Discordance between sources of molecular data
  suggests an underappreciated history of hybridization in Perityleae. Phylogenies
  support the monophyly of subtribe Peritylinae, a distinctive group possessing a
  four-lobed disc corolla; however, all of the phylogenetic trees generated in this
  study reject the monophyly of the most species-rich genus, Perityle, as well as
  its sections: Perityle sect. Perityle, Perityle sect. Laphamia, and Perityle sect.
  Pappothrix. Using reversible jump MCMC, our results suggest that morphological characters
  traditionally used to classify members of Perityleae have evolved multiple times
  within the group. A base chromosome number x?=?9 gave rise to higher base numbers
  in subtribe Peritylinae (x?=?12, 13, 16, 17, 18, and 19) through polyploidization,
  followed by ascending or descending dysploidy. Most taxa constitute a monophyletic
  lineage with a base chromosome number of x?=?17, with multiple neo-polyploidization
  events. These results demonstrate the advantages and obstacles of next-generation
  sequencing approaches in synantherology while laying the foundation for taxonomic
  revision and comparative study of the evolutionary ecology of Perityleae.'
