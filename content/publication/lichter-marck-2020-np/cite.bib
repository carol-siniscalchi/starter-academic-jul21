 abstract = {Abstract Rock daisies (Perityleae; Compositae) are a diverse
clade of seven genera and ca. 84 minimum-rank taxa that mostly
occur as narrow endemics on sheer rock cliffs throughout the
southwest United States and northern Mexico. Taxonomy of
Perityleae has traditionally been based on morphology and
cytogenetics. To test taxonomic hypotheses and utility of
characters emphasized in past treatments, we present the first
densely sampled molecular phylogenies of Perityleae and
reconstruct trait and chromosome evolution. We inferred
phylogenetic trees from whole chloroplast genomes, nuclear
ribosomal cistrons, and hundreds of low-copy nuclear genes using
genome skimming and target capture. Discordance between sources
of molecular data suggests an underappreciated history of
hybridization in Perityleae. Phylogenies support the monophyly
of subtribe Peritylinae, a distinctive group possessing a
four-lobed disc corolla; however, all of the phylogenetic trees
generated in this study reject the monophyly of the most
species-rich genus, Perityle, as well as its sections: Perityle
sect. Perityle, Perityle sect. Laphamia, and Perityle sect.
Pappothrix. Using reversible jump MCMC, our results suggest that
morphological characters traditionally used to classify members
of Perityleae have evolved multiple times within the group. A
base chromosome number x?=?9 gave rise to higher base numbers in
subtribe Peritylinae (x?=?12, 13, 16, 17, 18, and 19) through
polyploidization, followed by ascending or descending dysploidy.
Most taxa constitute a monophyletic lineage with a base
chromosome number of x?=?17, with multiple neo-polyploidization
events. These results demonstrate the advantages and obstacles
of next-generation sequencing approaches in synantherology while
laying the foundation for taxonomic revision and comparative
study of the evolutionary ecology of Perityleae.},
