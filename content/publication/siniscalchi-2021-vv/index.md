abstract: Phylogenetic studies in the Compositae are challenging due to the
  sheer size of the family and the challenges they pose for molecular tools, ranging
  from the genomic impact of polyploid events to their very conserved plastid genomes.
  The search for better molecular tools for phylogenetic studies led to the development
  of the family-specific Compositae1061 probe set, as well as the universal Angiosperms353
  probe set designed for all flowering plants. In this study, we evaluate the extent
  to which data generated using the family-specific kit and those obtained with the
  universal kit can be merged for downstream analyses. We used comparative
  methods to verify the presence of shared loci between probe sets. Using two sets
  of eight samples sequenced with Compositae1061 and Angiosperms353, we ran phylogenetic
  analyses with and without loci flagged as paralogs, a gene tree discordance analysis,
  and a complementary phylogenetic analysis mixing samples from both sample sets.
  Our results show that the Compositae1061 kit provides an average of 721
  loci, with 9?46% of them presenting paralogs, while the Angiosperms353 set yields
  an average of 287 loci, which are less affected by paralogy. Analyses mixing samples
  from both sets showed that the presence of 30 shared loci in the probe sets allows
  the combination of data generated in different ways. Combining data generated
  using different probe sets opens up the possibility of collaborative efforts and
  shared data within the synantherological community.
