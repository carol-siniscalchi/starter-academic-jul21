 abstract = {Premise Phylogenetic studies in the Compositae are challenging
due to the sheer size of the family and the challenges they pose
for molecular tools, ranging from the genomic impact of
polyploid events to their very conserved plastid genomes. The
search for better molecular tools for phylogenetic studies led
to the development of the family-specific Compositae1061 probe
set, as well as the universal Angiosperms353 probe set designed
for all flowering plants. In this study, we evaluate the extent
to which data generated using the family-specific kit and those
obtained with the universal kit can be merged for downstream
analyses. Methods We used comparative methods to verify the
presence of shared loci between probe sets. Using two sets of
eight samples sequenced with Compositae1061 and Angiosperms353,
we ran phylogenetic analyses with and without loci flagged as
paralogs, a gene tree discordance analysis, and a complementary
phylogenetic analysis mixing samples from both sample sets.
Results Our results show that the Compositae1061 kit provides an
average of 721 loci, with 9?46% of them presenting paralogs,
while the Angiosperms353 set yields an average of 287 loci,
which are less affected by paralogy. Analyses mixing samples
from both sets showed that the presence of 30 shared loci in the
probe sets allows the combination of data generated in different
ways. Discussion Combining data generated using different probe
sets opens up the possibility of collaborative efforts and
shared data within the synantherological community.},
