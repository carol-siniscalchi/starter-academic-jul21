 abstract = {Two new rupicolous and endangered species from the Caatinga are
described and illustrated. Chresta heteropappa is restricted to
the brejos de altitude (montane forests) from Northeastern
Ceará, growing on granite inselbergs. Chresta
subverticillata occurs in Northern Bahia, inhabiting quartzitic
outcrops on the Chapada Diamantina mountain range. Relationships
of the two new taxa to other Chresta species are discussed, and
a key for all species occurring in the Caatinga domain is
presented, as well as maps and illustrations, including field
pictures.},
