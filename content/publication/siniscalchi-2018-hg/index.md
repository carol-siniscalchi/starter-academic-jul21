abstract: Two new rupicolous and endangered species from the Caatinga are described
  and illustrated. Chresta heteropappa is restricted to the brejos de altitude (montane
  forests) from Northeastern Ceará, growing on granite inselbergs. Chresta subverticillata
  occurs in Northern Bahia, inhabiting quartzitic outcrops on the Chapada Diamantina
  mountain range. Relationships of the two new taxa to other Chresta species are discussed,
  and a key for all species occurring in the Caatinga domain is presented, as well
  as maps and illustrations, including field pictures.
