 abstract = {Premise: Hybrid capture with high-throughput sequencing (Hyb-Seq)
is a powerful tool for evolutionary studies. The applicability of
an Asteraceae family-specific Hyb-Seq probe set and the outcomes
of different phylogenetic analyses are investigated here.
Methods: Hyb-Seq data from 112 Asteraceae samples were organized
into groups at different taxonomic levels (tribe, genus, and
species). For each group, data sets of non-paralogous loci were
built and proportions of parsimony informative characters
estimated. The impacts of analyzing alternative data sets,
removing long branches, and type of analysis on tree resolution
and inferred topologies were investigated in tribe Cichorieae.
Results: Alignments of the Asteraceae family-wide Hyb-Seq locus
set were parsimony informative at all taxonomic levels. Levels of
resolution and topologies inferred at shallower nodes differed
depending on the locus data set and the type of analysis, and
were affected by the presence of long branches. Discussion: The
approach used to build a Hyb-Seq locus data set influenced
resolution and topologies inferred in phylogenetic analyses.
Removal of long branches improved the reliability of topological
inferences in maximum likelihood analyses. The Astereaceae
Hyb-Seq probe set is applicable at multiple taxonomic depths,
which demonstrates that probe sets do not necessarily need to be
lineage-specific.},
