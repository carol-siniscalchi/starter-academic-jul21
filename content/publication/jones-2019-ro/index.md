abstract: 'Premise: Hybrid capture with high-throughput sequencing (Hyb-Seq) is a
  powerful tool for evolutionary studies. The applicability of an Asteraceae family-specific
  Hyb-Seq probe set and the outcomes of different phylogenetic analyses are investigated
  here. Methods: Hyb-Seq data from 112 Asteraceae samples were organized into groups
  at different taxonomic levels (tribe, genus, and species). For each group, data
  sets of non-paralogous loci were built and proportions of parsimony informative
  characters estimated. The impacts of analyzing alternative data sets, removing long
  branches, and type of analysis on tree resolution and inferred topologies were investigated
  in tribe Cichorieae. Results: Alignments of the Asteraceae family-wide Hyb-Seq locus
  set were parsimony informative at all taxonomic levels. Levels of resolution and
  topologies inferred at shallower nodes differed depending on the locus data set
  and the type of analysis, and were affected by the presence of long branches. Discussion:
  The approach used to build a Hyb-Seq locus data set influenced resolution and topologies
  inferred in phylogenetic analyses. Removal of long branches improved the reliability
  of topological inferences in maximum likelihood analyses. The Astereaceae Hyb-Seq
  probe set is applicable at multiple taxonomic depths, which demonstrates that probe
  sets do not necessarily need to be lineage-specific.'
