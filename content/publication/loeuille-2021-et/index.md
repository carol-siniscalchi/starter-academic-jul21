abstract: Aldama (Heliantheae, Asteraceae) is a diverse genus in the sunflower family.
  To date, nearly 200 Asteraceae chloroplast genomes have been sequenced, but the
  plastomes of Aldama remain undescribed. Plastomes in Asteraceae usually show little
  sequence divergence, consequently, our hypothesis is that species of Aldama will
  be overall conserved. In this study, we newly sequenced 36 plastomes of Aldama and
  of five species belonging to other Heliantheae genera selected as outgroups (i.e.,
  Dimerostemma asperatum, Helianthus tuberosus, Iostephane heterophylla, Pappobolus
  lanatus var. lanatus, and Tithonia diversifolia). We analyzed the structure and
  gene content of the assembled plastomes and performed comparative analyses within
  Aldama and with other closely related genera. As expected, Aldama plastomes are
  very conserved, with the overall gene content and orientation being similar in all
  studied species. The length of the plastome is also consistent and the junction
  between regions usually contain the same genes and have similar lengths. A large
  ∼20 kb and a small ∼3 kb inversion were detected in the Large Single Copy (LSC)
  regions of all assembled plastomes, similarly to other Asteraceae species. The nucleotide
  diversity is very low, with only 1,509 variable sites in 127,466 bp (i.e., 1.18%
  of the sites in the alignment of 36 Aldama plastomes, with one of the IRs removed,
  is variable). Only one gene, rbcL, shows signatures of positive selection. The plastomes
  of the selected outgroups feature a similar gene content and structure compared
  to Aldama and also present the two inversions in the LSC region. Deletions of different
  lengths were observed in the gene ycf2. Multiple SSRs were identified for the sequenced
  Aldama and outgroups. The phylogenetic analysis shows that Aldama is not monophyletic
  due to the position of the Mexican species A. dentata. All Brazilian species form
  a strongly supported clade. Our results bring new understandings into the evolution
  and diversity of plastomes at the species level.
