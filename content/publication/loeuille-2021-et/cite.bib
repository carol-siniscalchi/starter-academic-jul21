 abstract = {Aldama (Heliantheae, Asteraceae) is a diverse genus in the
sunflower family. To date, nearly 200 Asteraceae chloroplast
genomes have been sequenced, but the plastomes of Aldama remain
undescribed. Plastomes in Asteraceae usually show little sequence
divergence, consequently, our hypothesis is that species of
Aldama will be overall conserved. In this study, we newly
sequenced 36 plastomes of Aldama and of five species belonging to
other Heliantheae genera selected as outgroups (i.e.,
Dimerostemma asperatum, Helianthus tuberosus, Iostephane
heterophylla, Pappobolus lanatus var. lanatus, and Tithonia
diversifolia). We analyzed the structure and gene content of the
assembled plastomes and performed comparative analyses within
Aldama and with other closely related genera. As expected, Aldama
plastomes are very conserved, with the overall gene content and
orientation being similar in all studied species. The length of
the plastome is also consistent and the junction between regions
usually contain the same genes and have similar lengths. A large
∼20 kb and a small ∼3 kb inversion were detected in the Large
Single Copy (LSC) regions of all assembled plastomes, similarly
to other Asteraceae species. The nucleotide diversity is very
low, with only 1,509 variable sites in 127,466 bp (i.e., 1.18%
of the sites in the alignment of 36 Aldama plastomes, with one of
the IRs removed, is variable). Only one gene, rbcL, shows
signatures of positive selection. The plastomes of the selected
outgroups feature a similar gene content and structure compared
to Aldama and also present the two inversions in the LSC region.
Deletions of different lengths were observed in the gene ycf2.
Multiple SSRs were identified for the sequenced Aldama and
outgroups. The phylogenetic analysis shows that Aldama is not
monophyletic due to the position of the Mexican species A.
dentata. All Brazilian species form a strongly supported clade.
Our results bring new understandings into the evolution and
diversity of plastomes at the species level.},
