abstract: The sunflower family, Asteraceae, comprises 10% of all flowering plant species
  and displays an incredible diversity of form. Asteraceae are clearly monophyletic,
  yet resolving phylogenetic relationships within the family has proven difficult,
  hindering our ability to understand its origin and diversification. Recent molecular
  clock dating has suggested a Cretaceous origin, but the lack of deep sampling of
  many genes and representative taxa from across the family has impeded the resolution
  of migration routes and diversifications that led to its global distribution and
  tremendous diversity. Here we use genomic data from 256 terminals to estimate evolutionary
  relationships, timing of diversification(s), and biogeographic patterns. Our study
  places the origin of Asteraceae at âˆ¼83 MYA in the late Cretaceous and reveals that
  the family underwent a series of explosive radiations during the Eocene which were
  accompanied by accelerations in diversification rates. The lineages that gave rise
  to nearly 95% of extant species originated and began diversifying during the middle
  Eocene, coincident with the ensuing marked cooling during this period. Phylogenetic
  and biogeographic analyses support a South American origin of the family with subsequent
  dispersals into North America and then to Asia and Africa, later followed by multiple
  worldwide dispersals in many directions. The rapid mid-Eocene diversification is
  aligned with the biogeographic range shift to Africa where many of the modern-day
  tribes appear to have originated. Our robust phylogeny provides a framework for
  future studies aimed at understanding the role of the macroevolutionary patterns
  and processes that generated the enormous species diversity of Asteraceae.
