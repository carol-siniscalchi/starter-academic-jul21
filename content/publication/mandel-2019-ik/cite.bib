 abstract = {The sunflower family, Asteraceae, comprises 10% of all flowering
plant species and displays an incredible diversity of form.
Asteraceae are clearly monophyletic, yet resolving phylogenetic
relationships within the family has proven difficult, hindering
our ability to understand its origin and diversification. Recent
molecular clock dating has suggested a Cretaceous origin, but the
lack of deep sampling of many genes and representative taxa from
across the family has impeded the resolution of migration routes
and diversifications that led to its global distribution and
tremendous diversity. Here we use genomic data from 256 terminals
to estimate evolutionary relationships, timing of
diversification(s), and biogeographic patterns. Our study places
the origin of Asteraceae at âˆ¼83 MYA in the late Cretaceous and
reveals that the family underwent a series of explosive
radiations during the Eocene which were accompanied by
accelerations in diversification rates. The lineages that gave
rise to nearly 95% of extant species originated and began
diversifying during the middle Eocene, coincident with the
ensuing marked cooling during this period. Phylogenetic and
biogeographic analyses support a South American origin of the
family with subsequent dispersals into North America and then to
Asia and Africa, later followed by multiple worldwide dispersals
in many directions. The rapid mid-Eocene diversification is
aligned with the biogeographic range shift to Africa where many
of the modern-day tribes appear to have originated. Our robust
phylogeny provides a framework for future studies aimed at
understanding the role of the macroevolutionary patterns and
processes that generated the enormous species diversity of
Asteraceae.},
