 abstract = {Chresta artemisiifolia, a new species from northern Bahia, is
described and illustrated. This species occurs on rock outcrops
amidst the dry Caatinga domain, and is morphologically related
with C. harleyi, C. hatschbachii , C. martii and C.
subverticillata. It is endemic to a region known as Boqueirão
da Onça, where a national park has recently been created. We
hope that the description of this taxon contributes to the
efforts in the preservation of this area.},
