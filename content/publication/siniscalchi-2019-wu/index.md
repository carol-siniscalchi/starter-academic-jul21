abstract: Chresta artemisiifolia, a new species from northern Bahia, is described
  and illustrated. This species occurs on rock outcrops amidst the dry Caatinga domain,
  and is morphologically related with C. harleyi, C. hatschbachii , C. martii and
  C. subverticillata. It is endemic to a region known as Boqueirão da Onça, where
  a national park has recently been created. We hope that the description of this
  taxon contributes to the efforts in the preservation of this area.
