abstract: 'Background -- Recent collection efforts in Serra do Padre Ângelo, Pico
  da Aliança, and Sete Salões State Park, all located in the state of Minas Gerais,
  have uncovered many botanical and zoological novelties. The region is an outlying
  campos rupestres area inserted in the Atlantic Forest phytogeographic domain, with
  its flora mostly related to that of the core campos rupestres area in the Espinhaço
  Range. Three species of Asteraceae, one of the most representative families in the
  campos rupestres, have been recently described for the area. Here we report two
  new species from the genera Lepidaploa and Lessingianthus and one range extension
  in Lessingianthus, both from subtribe Lepidaploinae.Methods -- This study was based
  on specimens from the herbaria HUFU, MBML, SPF, UFP, and on field observations.
  Morphological observations and measures were taken following standard practices.
  Preliminary conservation assessments are based on field observations and spatial
  analyses (i.e. extent of occurrence, area of occupancy), following IUCN guidelines
  and criteria.Results -- Two new species are described: Lepidaploa campirupestris,
  related to Lepidaploa aurea, differing from the latter by leaf indumentum, pedunculate
  heads, and number of florets; and Lessingianthus petraeus, related to Lessingianthus
  adenophyllus, but differing by leaf position and leaf blade morphology. We also
  report a range extension for Lessingianthus squamosus, previously known only for
  the state of Espı́rito Santo, ca 200 km away. Our results shed light on the interesting
  biogeography of the region, which mostly contains components of other campos rupestres
  areas intermixed with typical inselberg vegetation. It also highlights the importance
  of compiling floristic inventories in poorly collected localities and the need for
  conservation strategies for this biodiverse region.'
