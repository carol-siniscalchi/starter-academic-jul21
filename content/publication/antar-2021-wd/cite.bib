 abstract = {Background -- Recent collection efforts in Serra do Padre
Ângelo, Pico da Aliança, and Sete Salões State Park,
all located in the state of Minas Gerais, have uncovered many
botanical and zoological novelties. The region is an outlying
campos rupestres area inserted in the Atlantic Forest
phytogeographic domain, with its flora mostly related to that of
the core campos rupestres area in the Espinhaço Range. Three
species of Asteraceae, one of the most representative families in
the campos rupestres, have been recently described for the area.
Here we report two new species from the genera Lepidaploa and
Lessingianthus and one range extension in Lessingianthus, both
from subtribe Lepidaploinae.Methods -- This study was based on
specimens from the herbaria HUFU, MBML, SPF, UFP, and on field
observations. Morphological observations and measures were taken
following standard practices. Preliminary conservation
assessments are based on field observations and spatial analyses
(i.e. extent of occurrence, area of occupancy), following IUCN
guidelines and criteria.Results -- Two new species are described:
Lepidaploa campirupestris, related to Lepidaploa aurea, differing
from the latter by leaf indumentum, pedunculate heads, and number
of florets; and Lessingianthus petraeus, related to
Lessingianthus adenophyllus, but differing by leaf position and
leaf blade morphology. We also report a range extension for
Lessingianthus squamosus, previously known only for the state of
Espı́rito Santo, ca 200 km away. Our results shed light on
the interesting biogeography of the region, which mostly contains
components of other campos rupestres areas intermixed with
typical inselberg vegetation. It also highlights the importance
of compiling floristic inventories in poorly collected localities
and the need for conservation strategies for this biodiverse
region.},
