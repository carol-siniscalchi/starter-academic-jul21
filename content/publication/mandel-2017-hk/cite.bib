 abstract = {Abstract Comprising more than 25?000 species, the Sunflower
Family (Compositae or Asteraceae) is the largest family of
flowering plants. Many of its lineages have experienced recent
and rapid radiations, and the family has a deep and widespread
history of large-scale gene duplications and polyploidy. Many of
the most important evolutionary questions about the family's
diversity remain unanswered due to poor resolution and lack of
support for major nodes of the phylogeny. Our group has employed
a phylogenomics approach using Hyb-Seq that includes sequencing
?1000 low-copy number nuclear markers, plus partial plastomes for
large numbers of species. Here we discuss our progress to date
and present two phylogenies comprising nine subfamilies and 25
tribes using concatenated and coalescence-based analyses. We
discuss future plans for incorporating high-quality reference
genomes and transcriptomes to advance systematic and evolutionary
studies in the Compositae. While we have made great strides
toward developing tools for employing phylogenomics and resolving
relationships within Compositae, much work remains. Recently
formed global partnerships will work to solve the unanswered
evolutionary questions for this megafamily.},
