abstract: Abstract Comprising more than 25?000 species, the Sunflower Family (Compositae
  or Asteraceae) is the largest family of flowering plants. Many of its lineages have
  experienced recent and rapid radiations, and the family has a deep and widespread
  history of large-scale gene duplications and polyploidy. Many of the most important
  evolutionary questions about the family's diversity remain unanswered due to poor
  resolution and lack of support for major nodes of the phylogeny. Our group has employed
  a phylogenomics approach using Hyb-Seq that includes sequencing ?1000 low-copy number
  nuclear markers, plus partial plastomes for large numbers of species. Here we discuss
  our progress to date and present two phylogenies comprising nine subfamilies and
  25 tribes using concatenated and coalescence-based analyses. We discuss future plans
  for incorporating high-quality reference genomes and transcriptomes to advance systematic
  and evolutionary studies in the Compositae. While we have made great strides toward
  developing tools for employing phylogenomics and resolving relationships within
  Compositae, much work remains. Recently formed global partnerships will work to
  solve the unanswered evolutionary questions for this megafamily.
